								<h3>About Annie</h3>
								<br>
								<p>I was born in Georgia and immigrated with my family to the United States when I was eight years old after the fall of the Soviet Union. Growing up, I was raised on the recipes listed on this site. I was blessed that my family made every meal from scratch. My grandmother was an incredible baker and made the best cigareti pastries for which she frequently enlisted my help. My mom always makes gozinaki for New Year's Eve because Georgian tradition dictates that the first bite of the new year be something sweet. She also makes the best imeruli khachapuri and badrijani; I model mine after hers. Every single meal we eat includes a fresh salati. My father, a former film actor in Georgia, learned to make khinkali from locals while on a movie set for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqZgOL4BFAE" target="_blank"> Shepherd of Tusheti</a> (or Tushi Metskhvare in Georgian; my dad appears at the 9:41 mark). I make lobio for my girls almost weekly, and they tell me it is one of their favorite meals. Being Georgian, I add extra garlic and cilantro basically everything. These recipes hold a lot of meaning for my family and me as well as all Georgians, and I hope you try and love them as well.</p>
